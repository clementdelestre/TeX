# TeX - Web Interface for Kodi

TeX is a new web interface for Kodi made with Angular and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Browse your library. You can see your movies, TV shows and musics.
- Play musics in your browser
- Download medias directly from your browser
- Manage some Kodi settings
- Toggle CEC state (if the [script.json-cec](https://github.com/joshjowen/script.json-cec) addon is installed)

## Installation

In Kodi -> Settings -> Services -> Control
- Enable "Allow remote control via HTTP"
- Web interface : select "TeX"
- Enable "Allow remote control from application on this system"
- Enable "Allow remote control from application on others systems"

In your browser, navigate to "http://[your ip]:[Port]"
<br>You can find your ip in Kodi -> Settings -> System information
<br>The port is the port you have chosen in Kodi -> Settings -> Services -> Control -> Port

## Development stage

TeX is still in development. Some features are missing but should be added in the future.
<br>Current features should work well but have not been tested on many devices so consider it as a beta.

## Languages

Only English and French are supported for now. Others languages may be added later with the help of the community.

I will apreciate any help if you want to improve the project. You can do pull request on the dev branch and I will check it.
